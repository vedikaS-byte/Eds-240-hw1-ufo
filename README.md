# Homework #1 (Interpreting `{ggplot2}` code)

\*The full assignment description is avaiable on the [course website](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/course-materials/assignments/HW1.html).

## Description

The repository contains the code and figures used to interpret an infographic composed of multiple ggplot visualizations. This assignment involves interpreting and reflecting on code developed by Dan Oehm for his UFO Sightings visualization, which uses data from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html) to show total UFO sightings by state, the times of day sightings occur, and the most common UFO shapes. The interpretation also explores the methods behind layering, reproducibility, and the creation and arrangement of multiple visualizations alongside text.

## Contents

This repository is organized as follows and contains:

-   `README.md`: Markdown file detailing repository description, content, structure, data access, and references.

-   `HW1.qmd`: File containing the interpretation, explanation, and reflection of code written by Dan Oehm.

-   `HW1.html`: Rendered HTML file of interpretation analysis.

-   `ufo_sightings_infographic.png`: Finalized infographic of the UFO visualization analysis.

-   `fonts`: Contains the primary Google Fonts utilized in the analysis.

## Data Access

\*The data utilized in this analysis is not housed in this repository.

The [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html) is a publicly accessible database that records UFO sightings, including information on the reported shape of each UFO. Additional information regarding metadata for the version of the data set utilized in Oehm's analysis is linked here for [reference](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-06-20/readme.md#data-dictionary).
